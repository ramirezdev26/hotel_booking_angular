# Lab 04 â€“ TypeScript Advanced Concepts

## Summary of Activities

This lab focused on advanced TypeScript concepts, including configuration, object-oriented programming, and experimental decorators, all aligned with Capstone project requirements.

### Activity 1: TypeScript Introduction
- TypeScript installation and configuration with a strict `tsconfig.json` (strict mode, ES6 target, outDir).
- First script (`hello.ts`) with explicit types and functions.
- Advanced type exercises in `types.ts`: any, unknown, never, union, intersection, enums, mapped and utility types.

### Activity 2: Object-Oriented Programming in TypeScript
- Class modeling (`Room.ts`), inheritance (`Suite.ts`), and interfaces (`IBooking.ts`).
- Instantiation and testing in `demo.ts`, demonstrating classes, subclasses, and interface contracts.

### Activity 3.1: Experimental Decorators
- Implementation of minimal custom class and property decorators to simulate Angular's `@Component` and `@Input`.
- Refactoring for a minimal, functional approach.

## Code Review
